# loginGUI

The only 3 files that are running are loginpage, funccode, mainpage, and the database file. The rest were all for debugging purposes.

Pycharm also has a bug that doesn't allow tkinter to work, so all of this was done is vscode. You can execute this in terminal too, or anything running python 3.10+.

TO RUN THE PROGRAM, RUN LOGINPAGE.PY
